Say you want to convert a wav file (blah.wav) you want to use in your game. Here are the sequence of steps you can do in Matlab 
(or a free alternative to Matlab from GNU called Octave ï¿½ http://octave.org)  to make this happen:

1. Read the file and extract the samples as well as the frequency:

[Spls, fs] = wavread('blah.wav');

2. Downsample it, to get it to the frequency you want (11.025 kHz):

Spls = downsample(Spls, round(fs/11025));

3. Adjust the samples (originals are fractions between -1 and 1) to range between 0 and 15 (4-bit)

Spls = round((Spls+ 1)* 7.5);

4. write it to a file so you can cut and paste it into your C code:

file = fopen('blah.txt', 'w');

fprintf(file, 'unsigned char blah[] = {');

fprintf(file, '%d,', Spls);

fprintf(file, '};\n');

That's it, you should have a file (called blah.txt) with a declaration you can cut and paste in your code. 
There may be an extra commas in the output that you would have to remove.  You could make a convert.m file with these statements 
inside a subroutine and have a converter that can be invoked for conversion from matlab. (From Mitch Crooks)
